      <description>My name is Shereen
I am a user experience designer that specializes in both website and mobile applications. Recently graduating from UC Irvine with a B.S. in Informatics, I use my HCI specialization in order to create human-centered designs.
When I&amp;rsquo;m not creating iterative designs, I enjoy keeping up with hockey, eating at new restaurants, and watching the Office.
You can view my full resume here.
Have a project in mind?</description>
