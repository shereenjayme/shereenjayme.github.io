<p><strong>Name:</strong> Skype Redesign <br>

<strong>Tools Used:</strong> Photoshop lol</p>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This case study outlines a school project where I teamed up with four other students to redesign the application Skype. Within the span of ten weeks we identified usability issues with the Skype interface. We recruited users to help us understand what we thought the target audience was. These participants ranged from 15-25 year olds. With the help of these users, we redesigned the interface of Skype using their feedback. There was no coding involved in this project.</p>

<h3 id="the-approach">The Approach</h3>

<p>To make this case study easy to follow, each part is split into their own section and listed below.</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Understanding the Product:</strong> Application Research, Competitive Analysis</li>
<li><strong>Understanding Users:</strong> Interviews, Survey, Affinity Diagram</li>
<li><strong>Identifying Usability Issues:</strong> Usability tests, Cognitive Walkthrough</li>
<li><strong>The Redesign:</strong> Sketches, Wireframes, High Fidelity Prototypes</li>
<li><strong>Testing Redesign:</strong> Heuristic Evaluation</li>
<li><strong>Final Thoughts:</strong> Lessons Learned</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="understanding-the-product">Understanding the Product</h2>

<h3 id="application-research">Application Research</h3>

<p>Before we began the redesign, we needed to understand what Skype was and understand the reasons why it was created. Everyone in our group has used Skype in the past and we were familiar with the various functions but we never delved deep into the history of it. In order to successfully redesign the application, we needed to understand a few questions.</p>

<p>Through research, we were able to answer these questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly is Skype?</li>
<li>Who Skype was geared towards at creation?</li>
<li>Why was it created/what problems did it try to address?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>In addition to understanding the product itself, we needed to understand its competitors. We identified the strengths and weaknesses of four other applications that are relatively close to the functionality of Skype. We looked at two direct competitors - Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts, and two indirect competitors - Discord and Raidcall.</p>

<p><img src="/skyperedesign/competitiveanalysis.png#center" alt="comp analysis" width="650"/></p>

<h4 id="direct-competitor-comparison">Direct Competitor Comparison</h4>

<p>
With our research we found that Skype and its direct competitors, Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts, share all the major features with the exception of Facebook Messenger not having a Web Application anymore.
</p>

<h4 id="indirect-competitor-comparison">Indirect Competitor Comparison</h4>

<p>
Discord and Raidcall were the two indirect competitors we compared to Skype. We found that the user base differed with these applications because Discord and Raidcall are geared more towards gamers and gaming communities rather than working professionals.
</p>

<h2 id="understanding-users">Understanding Users</h2>

<h3 id="interviews">Interviews</h3>

<p>To understand our target audience more we interviewed people that fit our target population. Each member of our group interviewed two people within the 15-25 age range. We focused our interview questions on the user’s lifestyle, their Internet use, and their application use when on the Internet. If the participant has used Skype before we asked further questions about their past experiences with it.</p>

<p>From our interviews we found common themes between the ten participants:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skype was widely used because it was the only program that allowed voice and video chat for free</li>
<li>Participants preferred video chat over voice chat because it closely resembles face to face contact</li>
<li>Connectivity was a major issue when using Skype</li>
<li>Skype was rarely the preferred way to communicate over the Internet as it seems outdated and “looks like a child’s toy”</li>
</ul>

<p>From these interviews we found that although users love the features that Skype offers, it seems that the outdated interface as well as the connectivity issues are major issues for users.</p>

<h3 id="survey">Survey</h3>

<p>To obtain quick, general data from a large amount of people we created a survey that focused on Skype. We focused on asking questions about what features participants primarily use, what features they have tried in the past, and whether or not they use other applications instead of Skype. Each member of the group sent the survey out on social media and had a total of 118 participants.</p>

<p>From the survey we found that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most participants used Skype primarily for video chatting friends and family</li>
<li>Skype is outdated</li>
<li>59.3% of participants prefer Facebook Messenger over Skype</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="affinity-diagram">Affinity Diagram</h3>

<p>To collectively analyze our interview data we created an affinity diagram. Each member wrote down every important detail from our interviews on sticky notes and together we created groups based on the types of answers we received. From there, we created bigger, generalized groups that uncovered different themes.</p>

<h2 id="identifying-usability-issues">Identifying Usability Issues</h2>

<p>After understanding Skype more in depth and spending time with users, we had an idea of what users did not enjoy. However, we needed to dig deeper into potential issues. We did this by conducting usability tests and a cognitive walkthrough.</p>

<h3 id="usability-tests">Usability Tests</h3>

<p>We conducted usability tests with participants using the think-aloud protocol to understand their mindset when using Skype. Each member of the group was in charge with one usability test and we assigned another member to take notes while the test was in progress. As a group we devised a script for the test that included five tasks in total as well as a questionnaire at the end. The test and questionnaire took 30 to 45 minutes in total.</p>

<p>The five tasks that were used for these tests included:</p>

<ol>
<li>Log in, add a person to your contacts, and video call them</li>
<li>Screenshare with your contact</li>
<li>Group video chat with two contacts</li>
<li>Create a list with your contacts</li>
<li>Change privacy settings and update profile information</li>
</ol>

<p>From these usability tests we were able to conclude that there were a few issues regarding the user interface. The main issues uncovered were:</p>

<p><strong>look at the summary under assignment #3</strong> ======================</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>Ambiguity:</strong> Users had difficulty distinguishing between the many icons used in the application. For example, some participants thought the &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon would add a user to their contacts, however, that icon actually started a new conversation.</li>
<li><strong>Inconsistency:</strong> When users were trying to do task two (screensharing), another &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon appeared when the participant was in an active call that shows additional options when clicked. However, because the other &ldquo;+&rdquo; icon, users did not think of clicking that and instead spent time looking for a button that resembles a screen.</li>
<li><strong>Unintuitive:</strong></li>
</ul>

<h3 id="cognitive-walkthrough">Cognitive Walkthrough</h3>

<p>As a group, we conducted a cognitive walkthrough on Skype. We tested the four tasks below.</p>

<ol>
<li>Logging into Skype</li>
<li>Start a screen share in a video call</li>
<li>Private Skype profile</li>
<li>Add contacts to contact list</li>
</ol>

<p>We documented each step taken within the task being tested. For each step we answered these questions:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>What is the user’s goal at this point? Why is it their goal?</strong></li>
<li><strong>Are the necessary actions obviously available on the interface? (Is the action they need actually available in the interface?)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Once users see the control, will they recognize that it does what they want? (Do people recognize it’s the feature they want? Is it clear that it will do what they want)</strong></li>
<li><strong>After the action is taken, is the feedback appropriate? Will the user understand it so they can move on to the next action with confidence?</strong></li>
</ul>
