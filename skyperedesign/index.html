<p><strong>Name:</strong> Skype Redesign <br>
<strong>Role:</strong> UX/UI Designer (large emphasis on research)<br>

<h2 id="overview">Overview</h2>

<p>This case study outlines a school project where I teamed up with four other students to redesign the application Skype. Within the span of ten weeks we identified usability issues with the Skype interface. This project has a large emphasis on UX Research. We recruited users ranging from ages 15-25 to help us understand the target audience of the application. With the help of these users, we utilized UX research methods in order to uncover problems with Skype and redesign the UI. There was no coding involved in this project.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-the-product">Understanding the Product</h2>

<h3 id="application-research">Application Research</h3>

<p>Before we began the redesign, we needed to understand what Skype was and understand the reasons why it was created. Everyone in our group has used Skype in the past and we were familiar with the various functions but we never delved deep into the history of it. In order to successfully redesign the application, we needed to understand a few questions.</p>

<p>Through research, we were able to answer these questions.</p>

<ul>
<li>What exactly is Skype?</li>
<li>Who Skype was geared towards at creation?</li>
<li>Why was it created/what problems did it try to address?</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="competitive-analysis">Competitive Analysis</h3>

<p>In addition to understanding the product itself, we needed to understand its competitors. We identified the strengths and weaknesses of four other applications that are relatively close to the functionality of Skype. We looked at two direct competitors - Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts, and two indirect competitors - Discord and Raidcall.</p>

<p><img src="/skyperedesign/competitiveanalysis.png#center" alt="comp analysis" width="650"/></p>

<h4 id="direct-competitor-comparison">Direct Competitor Comparison</h4>

<p>
With our research we found that Skype and its direct competitors, Facebook Messenger and Google Hangouts, share all the major features with the exception of Facebook Messenger not having a Web Application anymore.
</p>

<h4 id="indirect-competitor-comparison">Indirect Competitor Comparison</h4>

<p>
Discord and Raidcall were the two indirect competitors we compared to Skype. We found that the user base differed with these applications because Discord and Raidcall are geared more towards gamers and gaming communities rather than working professionals.

<h2 id="understanding-users">Understanding Users</h2>

<h3 id="interviews">Interviews</h3>

<p>To understand our target audience more we interviewed people that fit our target population. Each member of our group interviewed two people within the 15-25 age range. We focused our interview questions on the user’s lifestyle, their Internet use, and their application use when on the Internet. If the participant has used Skype before we asked further questions about their past experiences with it.</p>

<p>From our interviews we found common themes between the ten participants:</p>

<ul>
<li>Skype was widely used because it was the only program that allowed voice and video chat for free</li>
<li>Participants preferred video chat over voice chat because it closely resembles face to face contact</li>
<li>Connectivity was a major issue when using Skype</li>
<li>Skype was rarely the preferred way to communicate over the Internet as it seems outdated and “looks like a child’s toy”</li>
</ul>

<h3 id="survey">Survey</h3>

<p>To obtain quick, general data from a large amount of people we created a survey that focused on Skype. We focused on asking questions about what features participants primarily use, what features they have tried in the past, and whether or not they use other applications instead of Skype. Each member of the group sent the survey out on social media and had a total of 118 participants.</p>

<p>From the survey we found that:</p>

<ul>
<li>Most participants used Skype primarily for video chatting friends and family</li>
<li>Skype is outdated</li>
<li>59.3% of participants prefer Facebook Messenger over Skype</li>
</ul>
